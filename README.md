# tool.kak
A generic tool plugin.
There are a lot of tools for a lot of usecase but the built in make plugin is just not
flexible enough to accomodate all those tools.

Creating a new plugin for every single tool requires a lot of boilerplate.
This is a framework to make supporting other tools easy and painless.
